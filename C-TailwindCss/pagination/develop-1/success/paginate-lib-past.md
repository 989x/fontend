### Ask

using nextJS 

In this file lodash is used, but I need a method that doesn't require lodash.
Can you write a new method for me?

using lodash
<paginate-lib-past.js /> 

### ChatGPT

Certainly! You can achieve pagination without using lodash by using vanilla JavaScript array methods. Here's a simple implementation:

deleted lodash
<paginate-lib-past.js /> 

This code uses the `slice` method to extract a portion of the array based on the `startIndex` and `pageSize`. The `slice` method takes two arguments: the starting index and the ending index (exclusive). This eliminates the need for lodash's `_.take` and `_.value` in your original code.
