In this file, an error was found in the api call, 
resulting in an unnecessary increase in api request costs.
I'll test it out. Found that the api was called 2 times.

This is the output from the console in the frontend.

<useEffect-fetchData.tsx />

It seems like the issue you're facing is related to the unnecessary increase in API request costs due to the `fetchData` function being called twice. The most probable reason for this behavior is the placement of the `useEffect` hook.

In your code, you have two `useEffect` hooks, one for fetching nearby places and another for fetching user favorites. Both of them run independently when the component mounts. Since the `fetchData` function for nearby places is not dependent on any variable changes, it runs every time the component mounts, leading to the extra API call.

To fix this, you can move the `fetchData` function into the same `useEffect` hook where you fetch user favorites. By doing so, both API calls will be triggered when `userID` changes, and you won't have an extra call for nearby places.

<useEffect-fetchData.tsx />

Now, the `fetchData` function for nearby places is inside the same `useEffect` as the user favorites, and it will only be called when `userID` changes. This should resolve the issue of unnecessary API calls.
