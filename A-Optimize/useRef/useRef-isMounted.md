It's gotten better, but there's still a problem when you first come to this page or refresh this page.
Found that the same API was called 2 times.

You can see this code in action, I took it from the console on my website.

<useRef-isMounted.tsx />

start useEffect setEstatesData
start useEffect limit-agents
start useEffect fetchUserFavorites
start useEffect setEstatesData
start useEffect limit-agents
start useEffect fetchUserFavorites
start useEffect limit-blogs

The issue of calling the same API multiple times when you first visit the page or refresh it might be related to the initial rendering of the component. When the component first mounts, the `useEffect` hooks will run, and this can lead to duplicate API calls.

To avoid these duplicate API calls, you can add a condition to ensure that the API calls are only made after the initial rendering. One common approach is to use a `useRef` to track whether the component has mounted or not. Here's how you can modify your code to address this issue:

<useRef-isMounted.tsx />

With this modification, the API calls for `setEstatesData`, `limit-agents`, and `limit-blogs` will only occur after the initial rendering of the component. The `isMounted` ref helps to skip these calls during the initial rendering, which should prevent the issue of calling the same API multiple times when first visiting or refreshing the page.

fetchDataForUserFavorites(); is error

I apologize for the oversight. It seems there was a mistake in the code. Let me correct that for you. Instead of calling `fetchDataForUserFavorites()` directly within the `useEffect`, you can move it outside the `useEffect` and call it after the initial rendering. Here's the corrected code:

<useRef-isMounted.tsx />

Now, the `fetchDataForUserFavorites` function is defined separately, and it's called within its own `useEffect` to avoid confusion and potential issues.
