using nextJS typescript

Need to use localStorage with this file, otherwise it will make too many api calls.
Because this code will be used on multiple pages.

The localStorage value will only be changed if the saveFavoriteProperty removeFavoriteProperty

<favorites-dev.ts />

### ChatGPT

To prevent making unnecessary API calls and manage the favorite properties in the localStorage, you can modify your code as follows. You can use the localStorage to store the user's favorite properties and update them as needed when the `saveFavoriteProperty` and `removeFavoriteProperty` functions are called.

Here's how you can do it:

<favorites-done.ts />

In this code, we use the `localStorage` to store and retrieve the user's favorite properties. When the `saveFavoriteProperty` and `removeFavoriteProperty` functions are called, we update the local storage accordingly. This way, you can avoid unnecessary API calls and maintain the user's favorite properties between page visits.

But fetchUserFavorites You still have to call the API from the backend.
How to extract values from LocalStorage first?
If there is a change Then call the API from the backend.

This is a way to save a lot on API calls.

### ChatGPT

I understand your requirement better now. You want to fetch user favorites from the backend API only when necessary, i.e., when the local storage doesn't have the data or when there's a change. Here's an updated approach:

<favorites-done.ts />

In this updated approach, we first attempt to load user favorites from localStorage. If the localStorage is empty or doesn't contain any favorites, we fetch the data from the backend API and update the localStorage. This ensures that you make an API call only when there is no data in localStorage or when there's a change in the user's favorites.

I'd like to edit the code a bit. If we save it as userFavorites You may encounter problems when on that website you change your userID or change a new user to a different user.

### ChatGPT

You're correct that if you store user-specific data like favorites using a static key in localStorage, it could lead to issues when switching users or changing user IDs. To address this concern, you can use a dynamic key based on the user's ID or session. Here's an updated version of the code to ensure the user-specific data is stored separately for each user:

<favorites-done.ts />

With this approach, each user's favorites are stored in localStorage under a unique key based on their userID. This ensures that user-specific data is kept separate, even when changing users or user IDs.

So that the values in LocalStorage remain intact.
Set LocalStorage to last only 1 day. 
If it expires do axios.get(`http://localhost:5000/api/user/card-favorite/${userID}`);

lib/dataExpiration.ts

```ts
export function checkExpire1Day(timestamp: string): boolean {
  const now = new Date().getTime();
  const dataTimestamp = new Date(timestamp).getTime();
  const oneDayInMilliseconds = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // 1 day in milliseconds

  return now - dataTimestamp > oneDayInMilliseconds;
}
```

### ChatGPT

To implement data expiration and refresh data from the backend if it has expired, you can integrate your `checkExpire1Day` function into the code. Here's an updated version of your code that checks for data expiration in localStorage and fetches data from the backend if necessary:

First, import the `checkExpire1Day` function:

```tsx
import { checkExpire1Day } from "./lib/dataExpiration"; // Update the import path as needed
```

Now, update your code to use this function for data expiration and fetching data:

<favorites-done.ts />

In this code, we check for data expiration using the `checkExpire1Day` function, and if the data has expired or doesn't exist in localStorage, we fetch it from the API and update localStorage with a new timestamp. This way, data is kept in localStorage for up to one day, and if it expires, a fresh API request is made.
