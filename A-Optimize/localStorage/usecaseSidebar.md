### Ask

using nextJS typescript

What should I do with this code?
userSidebar, blogSiderbar
It will have the same value every time. 
But the function of this code is to call the api every time.
when refreshing the page, which caused my API costs to increase a lot, unnecessarily

<usecaseSidebar.tsx />

### ChatGPT

To reduce unnecessary API calls and the associated costs, you can fetch the data for `userSidebar` and `blogSidebar` only when it's required. In your code, you are fetching this data every time the component mounts, which is why it's causing additional API requests when the page is refreshed. Instead, you can fetch this data once and store it in a way that it's accessible across page refreshes.

One way to do this is to use a combination of React's `useState`, `useEffect`, and the browser's `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` to cache the data. Here's an example of how you can modify your code to achieve this:

<usecaseSidebar.tsx />

With this code, data for `userSidebar` and `blogSidebar` will be fetched and stored in `localStorage` on the initial load, and subsequent visits or page refreshes will use the cached data, reducing unnecessary API calls and costs.

### Solve 

Argument of type 'string | null' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.
Type 'null' is not assignable to type 'string'.ts(2345) 
var localStorage: Storage

### ChatGPT

The error you're encountering is because `localStorage` can potentially return `null` when attempting to retrieve an item. To address this issue, you can perform a null check before trying to use the data retrieved from `localStorage`. Here's the modified code to handle the null value:

<usecaseSidebar.tsx />

By using `JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('yourKey') || 'defaultValue')`, we provide a default value of an empty array when `localStorage.getItem` returns `null`. This should resolve the type error and provide a default value for the state if the key is not found in `localStorage`.

### Ask

I would like to ask further, 
can we configure localStorage to save data for only 7 days? 

Because assuming that if data changes, 
the user will not know that the data has changed.

### ChatGPT

Yes, you can configure `localStorage` to save data for a specific duration, such as 7 days. To do this, you can store a timestamp along with your data and check the timestamp to determine if the data has expired. If it has expired, you can consider fetching new data. Here's how you can modify your code to implement this expiration logic:

<usecaseSidebar.tsx />

In this code, a timestamp is stored along with the data, and the `isDataExpired` function is used to check if the data has expired based on a 7-day threshold. If the data has expired, new data will be fetched. This way, you can ensure that the data is updated periodically, and the user is not using outdated information.
