In estateId change, want the index page to refresh itself.

To refresh the index page when the `estateId` changes, you can make use of the `useRouter` hook from Next.js in your index page component. By listening to the `router` object for route changes, you can trigger a refresh of the index page when the `estateId` changes.

Here's an example of how you can achieve this:

<index.ts/>

In this example, the `useEffect` hook is used to subscribe to the `routeChangeComplete` event of the `router` object. When a route change is detected, the `handleRouteChange` function is called. Inside this function, we check if the new URL contains the `/properties/` segment, indicating a change in the `estateId` parameter. If it does, we trigger a page refresh by calling `window.location.reload()`, which will reload the current URL and refresh the index page.

Note that this approach will refresh the entire page, including all components rendered on the index page. If you only want to refresh specific components or data, you can modify the code accordingly.
