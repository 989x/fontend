## Ask 

The code in CardProperty works correctly.
But encountered problems with slowness. 
As in the code sent earlier, it is a Properties file,
where CardProperty is called 12 times on 1 page.

Does that mean useEffect() in CardProperty will be executed 12 times?
When we go to the Properties page or reload the website.

```js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

const CardProperty = ({ data, userData, favorites }: any) => {
  const [isFavorite, setIsFavorite] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Check if the property is in the favorites array
    const isPropertyFavorite = favorites.includes(data.head.estateID);
    setIsFavorite(isPropertyFavorite);
  }, [data.head.estateID, favorites]);

  // Rest of the component remains unchanged
};
```

## ChatGPT

Yes, the `useEffect` in the `CardProperty` component will be executed for each instance of the component on the page. In your case, if the `CardProperty` component is rendered 12 times on one page, the `useEffect` hook will be called 12 times, once for each instance.

This behavior is by design in React. Each component instance has its own state and lifecycle methods, and the `useEffect` hook is specific to each instance. Therefore, if you have 12 instances of `CardProperty`, each will have its own independent execution of the `useEffect` hook.

However, if the slowness you are experiencing is related to the number of API requests being made or the processing done inside the `useEffect`, you might want to optimize your code. Here are a few suggestions:

### 1. Batch API Requests:

- If possible, batch API requests to fetch favorites for all properties at once instead of making separate requests for each property. This can reduce the number of API calls.

### 2. Memoization:

- If favorites is a large array and doesn't change often, consider memoizing it using the useMemo hook to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

```jsx
const CardProperty = ({ data, userData, favorites }: any) => {
  const [isFavorite, setIsFavorite] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Check if the property is in the memoized favorites array
    const isPropertyFavorite = favorites.includes(data.head.estateID);
    setIsFavorite(isPropertyFavorite);
  }, [data.head.estateID, favorites]);

  // Rest of the component remains unchanged
};
```

### 3. Optimize includes Check:

- If the favorites array is very large, consider using a more efficient data structure for checking whether an element is present. For example, you could convert favorites into a Set and use the has method for faster lookups.

```jsx
const CardProperty = ({ data, userData, favorites }: any) => {
  const [isFavorite, setIsFavorite] = useState(false);

  const favoritesSet = new Set(favorites);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Check if the property is in the Set
    const isPropertyFavorite = favoritesSet.has(data.head.estateID);
    setIsFavorite(isPropertyFavorite);
  }, [data.head.estateID, favoritesSet]);

  // Rest of the component remains unchanged
};
```

These optimizations can help improve performance, especially when dealing with a large number of instances of the `CardProperty` component on a single page.
