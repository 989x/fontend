### Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'prototype' of null

### problem

I just logged into my openERP account and this openERP Client error pops out. And I can't access to any of the modules when this happened. I don't quite know what is the cause. Is there anyone who knows of a solution to this?

Hi,

This was seen few months back if I am not wrong.

Please either update the code or clear the browser cache, which should help.

Thanks.
