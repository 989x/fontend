19:6  Warning: React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'props'. Either include it or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

The warning you're seeing is related to the `props` dependency in the `useEffect` dependency array. To resolve this warning, you can destructure the specific `props` object that you need outside of the `useEffect` and use that specific prop inside the effect. Here's how you can do it:

<RefreshTokenHandler.js />

In this code:

1. We destructure the `setInterval` prop directly in the function parameter list, removing the need to reference `props.setInterval`.
2. We include `session` and `setInterval` in the `useEffect` dependency array to satisfy the `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` rule and ensure that the effect runs when `session` or `setInterval` changes.
