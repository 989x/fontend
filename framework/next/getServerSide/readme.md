### Ask

can use this way ?

export async function getServerSideProps(context: any) { }

### ChatGPT

Yes, you can also use `getServerSideProps` to fetch data from an API in NextJS. This function runs on every request and fetches data at runtime, rather than at build time like `getStaticProps`. This can be useful if your data changes frequently and you need to ensure that the page is always up-to-date.

Here's an example implementation using `getServerSideProps`:

<getServerSideProps-fetch.tsx />

With this implementation, you should be able to access your property page at `http://localhost:3000/property/${estate_id}` and have it render the appropriate property data fetched from your API on every request.



### Ask

and use axios

### ChatGPT

Yes, you can also use Axios to fetch data from your API in NextJS.

Here's an example implementation using `getServerSideProps` and Axios:

<getServerSideProps-axios.tsx />

With this implementation, you should be able to access your property page at `http://localhost:3000/property/${estate_id}` and have it render the appropriate property data fetched from your API using Axios on every request.



### Ask

getServerSideProps function I would like it to be more complex, in case an error occurs, it can be detected to solve the problem.

### ChatGPT

Sure, you can make the `getServerSideProps` function more complex and add error handling to it.

Here's an example implementation using `getServerSideProps`, Axios, and error handling:

<getServerSideProps-axios-try.tsx />

In this implementation, we use a `try`/`catch` block to handle any errors that occur during the fetch. If an error occurs, we log it to the console and return a `notFound` flag to indicate that the page should return a 404 error. We also return `estate: null` to ensure that the page component doesn't attempt to render with empty data.

With this implementation, you should be able to handle errors that occur during the fetch and provide a more robust error-handling solution for your `getServerSideProps` function.
