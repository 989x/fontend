### Ask

The code in the two files works the same.
i.e. estateData can be null or not contain a value. But why are there different useState methods?

in file Manage() use 
useState<any[]>([]);

```js
const [estateData, setEstateData] = useState<any[]>([]);
```

in file Manage() use 
useState<any[] | null>(null);

```js
const [estatesData, setEstatesData] = useState<any[] | null>(null);
```

The difference in the usage of `useState` in the two files boils down to the initial value you are providing for the state.

In the `Manage` component, you're initializing `estateData` with an empty array `[]`:

```js
const [estateData, setEstateData] = useState<any[]>([]);
```

This means that `estateData` will always be an array, even if it's empty initially. It won't be `null`.

On the other hand, in the `UserDetail` component, you're initializing `estatesData` with `null`:

```js
const [estatesData, setEstatesData] = useState<any[] | null>(null);
```

Here, you're allowing `estatesData` to be either an array or `null`. This choice may be more suitable if you want to explicitly represent the absence of data before fetching it.

Both approaches are valid and depend on your use case. Using `[]` as an initial value implies that the state will always be an array, even if it's empty, while using `null` allows for a more explicit representation of the absence of data.

So, if in your application it makes sense to distinguish between "no data" and "empty data," you might prefer the `null` initialization. If having an empty array always, even before fetching, is more appropriate for your application logic, then using `[]` as the initial value is a good choice.
