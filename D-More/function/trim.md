### what is .trim

The `.trim()` function is a built-in JavaScript method that removes whitespace from both ends of a string. It returns a new string with the leading and trailing spaces removed.

For example:

```js
const str = "   Hello, World!   ";
const trimmedStr = str.trim();
console.log(trimmedStr); // Output: "Hello, World!"
```

In the context of the code we discussed, `.trim()` is used to remove any leading or trailing spaces from the `propertySearch`, `propertyType`, and `propertyStatus` values before including them in the query parameters for the URL. This ensures that if there are any unintentional spaces in the input values, they are ignored and not included in the search query.
