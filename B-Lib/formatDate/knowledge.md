May I ask, what is the difference between these 2?

export function formatDate(dateString: string) {
export function formatDate(dateString: string): string {

In TypeScript, the difference between these two function declarations lies in the return type annotation:

1. `export function formatDate(dateString: string) {`
- This declaration specifies that the `formatDate` function takes a `dateString` parameter of type `string` but does not specify its return type. It means TypeScript will infer the return type based on what the function actually returns. If the function does not return an explicit value using the `return` keyword, TypeScript will infer the return type as `void`, meaning the function doesn't return anything.

2.`export function formatDate(dateString: string): string {`
- This declaration specifies both the parameter type and the return type. It states that the `formatDate` function takes a `dateString` parameter of type `string` and returns a value of type `string`.

In most cases, it's a good practice to specify the return type explicitly using the : `returnType` syntax, as it helps make your code more self-documenting and can catch type errors during development. If you omit the return type, TypeScript will try to infer it, but it's better to be explicit, especially for functions that have a clearly defined return type.

The two function declarations you've provided differ in terms of the return type annotation:

1. `export function formatDate(dateString: string):` This declaration specifies that the `formatDate` function takes a single argument `dateString` of type `string`, but it does not specify a return type. In TypeScript, when you don't specify a return type, it is implicitly inferred as `any`. This means the function can return any type of value, and TypeScript won't enforce a specific return type.

2. `export function formatDate(dateString: string): string {`: This declaration also specifies that the `formatDate` function takes a single argument `dateString` of type `string`, and it explicitly specifies the return type as `string`. This means that the function is expected to return a value of type `string`, and TypeScript will enforce this constraint. If the function doesn't return a `string`, TypeScript will raise a type error.

In summary, the primary difference is that the second declaration provides a clear and explicit type annotation for the return value, making it more type-safe, while the first declaration allows for an implicit `any` return type, which is less type-safe. It's generally a good practice in TypeScript to provide explicit type annotations for function return types when you know what type of value the function should return.
