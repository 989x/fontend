Can you show how the code you sent works? 
BreadcrumbsShort, There will be 2 formats for working, a format with buttonText value or a format with value buttonTextLoca any one

Certainly! The `BreadcrumbsShort` component is designed to display a breadcrumb trail with two possible formats: one with a `buttonText` value and another with a `buttonTextLoca` value. I'll provide examples of both formats:

### BreadcrumbsShort with `buttonText`:

In this format, you pass the `buttonText` prop with a string value directly to the component.

```jsx
<BreadcrumbsShort
  linkHref="/home"
  linkText="Home"
  buttonText="Button Text"
/>
```

This will render a breadcrumb trail with a link to "Home" and a button with the text "Button Text" like this:

```
Home / Button Text
```

### BreadcrumbsShort with `buttonTextLoca`:

In this format, you pass the `buttonTextLoca` prop with a string value that corresponds to a translated text key. The translation will be fetched using the `useDictionary` hook.

```jsx
<BreadcrumbsShort
  linkHref="/about"
  linkText="About"
  buttonTextLoca="button.translation.key"
/>
```

Assuming that `button.translation.key` corresponds to the translated text you want, this will render a breadcrumb trail with a link to "About" and a button with the translated text obtained from your dictionary like this:

```
About / Translated Text
```

In both cases, the `BreadcrumbsShort` component will handle rendering the breadcrumb trail with the provided link and text, and it will conditionally render the button text based on whether `buttonText` or `buttonTextLoca` is provided.

### The `BreadcrumbsFull` component is designed to display a breadcrumb trail with optional special breadcrumb and regular breadcrumbs. Let me explain how it works when put to use.

Here's an example of how you can use the `BreadcrumbsFull` component:

```jsx
import { BreadcrumbsFull } from "@/lib/Breadcrumbs";

const breadcrumbsData = [
  { label: "Home", url: "/home" },
  { label: "Category", url: "/category" },
  { label: "Product", url: "/product" },
];

const specialBreadcrumbData = {
  label: "Special Page",
  url: "/special-page",
};

// Inside your JSX or component render
<BreadcrumbsFull
  specialBreadcrumb={specialBreadcrumbData}
  breadcrumbs={breadcrumbsData}
/>
```

In this example:

1. `breadcrumbsData` is an array of regular breadcrumbs. Each object in the array represents a breadcrumb item with a `label` (the text of the breadcrumb) and a `url` (the URL it links to). You can have as many breadcrumb items as needed.
2. `specialBreadcrumbData` is an object representing a special breadcrumb. It has a `label` for the text and a url for the link. This special breadcrumb will be rendered before the regular breadcrumbs.

When you render the `BreadcrumbsFull` component with these props, it will generate a breadcrumb trail like this:

```
Special Page / Home / Category / Product
```

Here's how the component works:

- It first checks if a `specialBreadcrumb` is provided. If it is, it renders the special breadcrumb with its link and label.
- Next, it iterates over the regular breadcrumbs provided in the `breadcrumbs` prop and renders them with their respective links and labels. The breadcrumbs are separated by "/" characters.

So, the `BreadcrumbsFull` component allows you to create a breadcrumb trail with a special breadcrumb followed by regular breadcrumbs. This can be useful for navigating hierarchical content or providing context within your web application.
